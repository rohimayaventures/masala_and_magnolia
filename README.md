# 🌙 Masala & Magnolia  
### A Journey of Recipes and Stories from Our Maharashtrian and Southern Kitchen

Welcome home. This repository is a living, breathing cookbook–memoir where **food, family, and faith** braid together. Here you’ll find buttery dosas and flaky biscuits, jaggery-sweet memories and magnolia-soft mornings, turmeric sunsets and cast-iron midnights. It’s a love letter to a blended life—**Maharashtrian** roots meeting **Southern** soul—told in the language of heat, spice, and tenderness.

## ✨ What Makes This Book Different
- **Not** a traditional cookbook. It’s a **threshold**—between cultures, between grief and grace, between the kitchen light and the moonlit porch.
- Every recipe carries a story. Every story carries a flavor.  
- We use **moon phases** as seasonal/emotional wayfinding: New → Waxing → Full → Waning → Dark.

## 🌕 Motifs & Notes
- Moon glyphs, Phoenix & Peacock flourishes, and small “handwritten” family notes:
  - **Hannah’s Heart** — curation, care, and clarity  
  - **Prasad’s Tips** — technique, fire, and focus  
  - **Gracie’s Sass** — honesty & humor  
  - **Denali’s Corner** — wonder, color, and small hands in big bowls
