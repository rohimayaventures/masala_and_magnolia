# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Masala & Magnolia. Please follow these guidelines.

Branching
- Use `feature/*` for new features or content additions.
- Use `docs/*` for documentation changes.
- Use `fix/*` for bug fixes.

Commits & PRs
- Use Conventional Commits (feat, fix, chore, docs, style, refactor, perf, test).
- Open a PR referencing a related issue when appropriate.
- Keep PRs small and focused; include a short description of what changed and why.

Code Review & Checks
- CI runs markdown lint and link checks on PRs. Fix lint/link issues before merging.
