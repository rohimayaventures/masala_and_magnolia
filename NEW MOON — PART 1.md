# 🌙 **INTRO TO THE NEW MOON PHASE**  
*Finding Home in Each Other’s Kitchens*

The New Moon is where everything begins.

It’s the phase of curiosity, discovery, and falling in love with flavors that once belonged to someone else’s world. When Prasad and I first started cooking together, it wasn’t fancy or structured — it was chaotic, hilarious, delicious, and deeply meaningful.

We learned to speak each other’s culinary languages long before we learned to speak each other’s emotional ones.

He taught me that the sizzle of mustard seeds in hot oil isn’t just a sound — it is the announcement of comfort.  
I taught him that butter can solve almost any emotional crisis if applied in large enough quantities.

This section is all about simple beginnings, gentle flavors, and the kind of food that feels like someone holding your hands and saying:

> “You’re safe. You’re home. You can set everything down now.”

Here, you’ll find:
- Chai recipes that shaped our mornings  
- Comfort drinks that soothed both of us through long, overwhelming days  
- Simple breakfasts that taught us how to blend our cultures one small bite at a time  

This is where the story starts.  
Softly.  
Warmly.  
Like the first light of a new moon.
