# 🌙 **Cultural Pantry Essentials**  
## *The Ingredients That Built Us*

Every kitchen has a soul.  
Ours has *two.*

One grew up with turmeric-stained fingertips, the crackle of cumin in ghee, and the soft rhythm of chapatis puffing on a flame.  
The other grew up with cast-iron skillets warming slow mornings, biscuits rising like prayer, and magnolia-scented summers that tasted like sweetness and stretch and strength.

When we blended our worlds, our pantry became more than ingredients.  
It became a **story**,  
a **migration**,  
a **marriage**,  
a **rebirth**.

This chapter is not just a list — it’s the map of our life together.  
The essentials of a kitchen where *Maharashtra meets the American South,* where fire meets softness, where heritage becomes home.

# 🪔 **MAHARASHTRIAN ESSENTIALS**  
### *The fire, the earth, the heartbeat of spice.*

Maharashtrian cooking is bold but balanced, earthy yet bright, comforting and fiery all at once.  
These ingredients form the base of the meals Prasad grew up with — the flavors he carried with him across continents.

## 🌶️ **Whole Spices & Seeds**

### **Cumin Seeds (Jeera)**  
Earthy, warm, grounding.  
Blooming cumin in hot ghee is the fragrance of home in Western India.  
**Use:** dals, rice, sabzi, chutneys.

### **Mustard Seeds (Rai)**  
Sharp, peppery, essential.  
They *pop* when they’re ready — a tiny firework that says, “begin cooking now.”  
**Use:** tadka (tempering), pickles, coastal curries.

### **Fenugreek Seeds (Methi)**  
Bitter, caramel-like, deeply healing.  
**Use:** digestive dishes, spice blends.

### **Coriander Seeds**  
Citrusy and versatile.  
**Use:** ground into masalas, whole in marinades.

### **Fennel Seeds (Saunf)**  
Sweet and aromatic.  
In our kitchen, they bridge Indian masala with Southern desserts in surprising ways.
