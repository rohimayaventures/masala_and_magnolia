---

# 🍳 **Step-by-Step Instructions (Beginner Friendly)**

### **1. Dry roast the semolina.**
Heat a pan on medium-low.  
Add semolina and roast for **3–4 minutes**, stirring constantly.  
It should smell warm, toasty, and nutty—**never brown**.

### **2. Bloom the spices.**
In another pan, heat butter + oil.  
Add mustard seeds. When they pop, add cumin, curry leaves, and green chili.  
Let everything dance and sizzle for **20–30 seconds**.

### **3. Build the base.**
Add onion → sauté until soft and translucent.  
Add tomato, peas, and carrots.  
Cook until tomatoes become soft and glossy.

### **4. Add turmeric + water.**
Pour in 2.5 cups water.  
Add salt. Bring to a rolling boil.

### **5. Stream in the semolina.**
Slowly sprinkle roasted semolina with one hand  
while stirring with the other  
to prevent clumps.  
Stir gently on low heat for **3–5 minutes** until thick.

### **6. Finish with lemon + cilantro.**

### **7. Drizzle Magnolia butter on top.**
Let it melt into all the tiny grains like sunshine spreading across morning rooftops.

## ⏱ **While this rests…**
Prep chai, toast nuts, or warm up poha or dosa to serve alongside.

---

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**
- **If it becomes too thick:** Add 2–3 tbsp hot water and stir.  
- **If it becomes lumpy:** Break lumps with the back of a spoon, add a splash of water.  
- **If spices burn:** Start over—burnt mustard seeds turn the whole dish bitter.

---

## 🌱 **Variations**
- **Southern Style:** Add sautéed bell peppers and finish with paprika.  
- **Maharashtrian Style:** Add a pinch of goda masala.  
- **Protein Boost:** Add toasted cashews or chickpeas.

---

## 🍽 **Pairings**
- Ginger chai  
- Fresh fruit  
- Yogurt with honey

# ✨ **Recipe 17 — Prasad’s Quick Jaggery Peanut Chikki**
**Cultural Tag:** Maharashtrian Classic • Festive Sweet

## ⏱ Prep Time: 5 min
## 🔥 Cook Time: 10 min

---

## 🥣 **Ingredients**
- 1 cup (150g) roasted peanuts  
- ¾ cup (120g) jaggery (gul)  
- 1 tbsp (14g) ghee or butter  
- Pinch of salt  
- ¼ tsp (1g) cardamom  

**Veg/Vegan:** Use coconut oil instead of ghee.

---

# 🍳 **Beginner-Friendly Steps**

### **1. Prep your tray.**
Grease a small steel plate or baking tray with ghee.  
(This step saves your sanity.)

### **2. Melt the jaggery.**
Add ghee + jaggery to a small pan.  
Heat on low until jaggery melts.  
Stir until you see **tiny bubbles**—not large angry ones.

### **3. Test the syrup.**
Drop a tiny bit into cold water.  
If it forms a brittle ball → ready.  
If it bends → cook 30 seconds more.

### **4. Add peanuts + cardamom.**
Mix fast but gently.

### **5. Spread + flatten.**
Pour onto tray → flatten using a greased rolling pin or bowl bottom.  
Cut into squares after **2 minutes**.

---

## ⏱ **While this cools…**
Warm some chai, call a loved one, or put on a happy song.

---

## 🛠 **Troubleshooting**
- **If chikki becomes chewy:** You undercooked the syrup—reheat gently.  
- **If it becomes rock-hard:** Next time cook 10–20 seconds less.  
- **If peanuts separate:** Mix while syrup is still fluid.

---

## 🍽 Pairings
- Masala chai  
- Warm milk  
- Fresh fruit

## 💬 **Prasad’s Tips**
“Use good jaggery. Not the sad brittle kind that smells like cardboard.”
