# 🌙 **THE NEW MOON — The Beginning of Us**

Every story has a beginning.  
But not all beginnings are loud.  
Some begin quietly — in the soft dark, in the hush before dawn, in the spaces where two lives are trembling toward each other.

The **New Moon** is that tender, holy place.

It is the moment before commitment.  
Before certainty.  
Before you know what the future tastes like — but your heart whispers, _stay._

In our blended kitchen, the New Moon was:

✨ My first attempt at dal that tasted like home  
✨ Prasad’s first attempt at biscuits that didn’t become weapons  
✨ The way we watched each other cook — curious, hopeful  
✨ The silent negotiations: butter vs. ghee, skillet vs. kadai  
✨ The trust it took to hand someone else your memories and say,  
**“Teach me how to love you through this food.”**

This phase honors the early meals — the gentle ones — the ones that didn’t need to impress.  
They only needed to nourish.

The first ten recipes are simple because we were simple then too — learning, adjusting, laughing, burning things, forgiving each other anyway.

Welcome to the New Moon.  
A beginning carved from softness.

If love had a temperature, it would be the warmth of dal simmering quietly on the stove.

This was the first dish Prasad ever asked for — not because it was fancy, but because it was _home._

For me, it was the dish that taught me that sometimes love is learned in simmering.

## 🍚 **Beginner Walkthrough (The Gentle Dal Ritual)**

First, let the water run through your fingers as you rinse the dal.  
Feel how it softens in your hands.

Let the pot simmer like a promise.  
Dal teaches patience — it softens only when it’s ready.

When the ghee melts, breathe deeply.  
When the cumin pops, listen — that sound is a homecoming.

Pour the tadka like you’re blessing the dish.

Taste it.  
If your heart needs sweetness today, add jaggery.  
There is no wrong choice.
