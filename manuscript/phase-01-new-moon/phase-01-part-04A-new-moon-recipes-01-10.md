# 🌙 **THE NEW MOON — The Beginning of Us**

Every story has a beginning.  
But not all beginnings are loud.  
Some begin quietly — in the soft dark, in the hush before dawn, in the spaces where two lives are trembling toward each other.

The **New Moon** is that tender, holy place.

It is the moment before commitment.  
Before certainty.  
Before you know what the future tastes like — but your heart whispers, *stay.*

In our blended kitchen, the New Moon was:

✨ My first attempt at dal that tasted like home  
✨ Prasad’s first attempt at biscuits that didn’t become weapons  
✨ The way we watched each other cook — curious, hopeful  
✨ The silent negotiations: butter vs. ghee, skillet vs. kadai  
✨ The trust it took to hand someone else your memories and say,  
**“Teach me how to love you through this food.”**

This phase honors the early meals — the gentle ones — the ones that didn’t need to impress.  
They only needed to nourish.

The first ten recipes are simple because we were simple then too — learning, adjusting, laughing, burning things, forgiving each other anyway.

Welcome to the New Moon.  
A beginning carved from softness.

# 🌙✨ **RECIPE 01 — Varan (Simple Toor Dal)**  
**Cultural Tag:** Maharashtrian Classic · Everyday Comfort  
**Phoenix/Peacock Motif:** 🪔🌙 quiet warmth, ancestral simplicity

---

## ❤️ **THE STORY**
If love had a temperature, it would be the warmth of dal simmering quietly on the stove.

This was the first dish Prasad ever asked for — not because it was fancy, but because it was *home.*  
For him, Varan was childhood. Security. The meal his mother made when the world felt heavy.

For me, it was the dish that taught me that sometimes love is learned in simmering.

---

## 🍚 **Beginner Walkthrough (The Gentle Dal Ritual)**  
First, let the water run through your fingers as you rinse the dal.  
Feel how it softens in your hands.

Let the pot simmer like a promise.  
Dal teaches patience — it softens only when it’s ready.

When the ghee melts, breathe deeply.  
When the cumin pops, listen — that sound is a homecoming.

Pour the tadka like you’re blessing the dish.

Taste it.  
If your heart needs sweetness today, add jaggery.  
There is no wrong choice.
