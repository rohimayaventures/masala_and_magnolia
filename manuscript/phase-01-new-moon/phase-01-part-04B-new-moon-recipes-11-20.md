# 🌙 **New Moon — Recipes 11–20**

These next ten recipes represent the middle of our New Moon journey —  
the place where beginnings become habits,  
and where two people start to trust each other in the kitchen.

They are simple because beginnings should be simple.  
But each one carries a piece of us —  
Southern comfort, Maharashtrian rhythm,  
and the emergence of our own shared flavor.
