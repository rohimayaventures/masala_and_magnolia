# 🌙 **New Moon — Recipes 21–30**

Here we begin to stretch into deeper comfort.

These next ten recipes mark the moment in our New Moon where:

- our confidence grew,
- our fusion instincts sharpened,
- our hearts learned each other’s flavors,
- and our shared kitchen began to speak in one language.

These are the dishes created during late-night cooking,  
quiet afternoons,  
and all the “let’s experiment and see what happens” moments  
that shaped our earliest memories together.

Let’s continue.

## 🍚 Beginner Walkthrough

Sabudana requires patience — like getting to know someone shy.  
Too much water turns it mushy, too little leaves it hard.  
Treat it gently and it becomes luminous.

## ✅ Troubleshooting

- Sticky → over-soaked
- Hard centers → not enough soaking
- Mushy → too much stirring
