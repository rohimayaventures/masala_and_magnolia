# 🌙✨ **Phase 1 — New Moon**  
## **Part 4F — Recipes 26–30**

These five dishes are the final notes of our New Moon section —  
the flavors that helped us learn each other’s rhythms,  
the dishes we created on evenings when we were tired but wanted connection,  
and recipes that represent gentle nourishment rather than performance.

They are simple, heartfelt, and full of quiet warmth.

# ✨ **Recipe 26 — Cast-Iron Chili Garlic Mushrooms**
**Cultural Tag:** Fusion Appetizer • Fire + Earth  
**Motif:** 🔥🍄 grounded heat

## ⏱ Prep Time: 8 min  
## 🔥 Cook Time: 12 min

---

## 🥣 Ingredients (Serves 2–3)
- 3 cups (250g) mushrooms, sliced  
- 1.5 tbsp oil  
- 4 cloves garlic, minced  
- ½ tsp chili flakes or ¼ tsp Maharashtrian chili powder  
- ½ tsp black pepper  
- ¾ tsp salt  
- 1 tbsp lemon juice  
- Optional: ½ tsp soy sauce (fusion umami)

---

# 🍳 **Beginner-Friendly Instructions**

### **1. Heat a cast-iron skillet until hot.**  
Mushrooms need a *confident* pan.

### **2. Add oil + garlic.**  
Let the garlic become fragrant — not brown.

### **3. Add mushrooms in a single layer.**  
Do NOT stir for the first 2 minutes.  
This is where the good caramelization happens.

### **4. Add spices + salt.**

### **5. Stir and cook until golden and glossy.**

### **6. Finish with lemon + optional soy.**

---

## ⏱ While these cook…  
Warm bread, chop herbs, or prep a small salad.

---

## 🛠 Troubleshooting
- **Watery mushrooms?** You stirred too soon.  
- **Garlic bitter?** Heat too high.  
- **Not browning?** Pan wasn’t hot enough.
