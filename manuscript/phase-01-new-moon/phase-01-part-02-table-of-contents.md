# 📖 **Table of Contents**

## _Masala & Magnolia — A Journey of Recipes & Stories from Our Maharashtrian and Southern Kitchen_

A cookbook–memoir is not just a list of recipes.  
It is a constellation.  
A map of the meals, memories, and moon phases that shaped a blended family.

This Table of Contents is built to guide you not only through dishes,  
but through _emotions, seasons, and cultural crossings_.

Each Phase opens like a chapter of becoming.  
Each Part is a lantern on the path.  
Every recipe is a story.

# 💠 **A Note for the Reader**

This book is meant to be read slowly.  
Not just cooked from — _lived with._

Flip through phases like walking through seasons.  
Return to recipes the way you revisit memories.  
Let each moon pull you into a slightly different version of yourself.

Welcome to the table.  
We saved you a seat.
