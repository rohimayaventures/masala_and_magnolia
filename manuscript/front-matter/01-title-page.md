**Masala & Magnolia**  
_A Journey of Recipes & Stories from Our Maharashtrian and Southern Kitchen_  
Written by **Hannah Nichole Kraulik Pagade** & **Prasad Pagade**  
Published by **Rohimaya Publishing**

© 2025 Rohimaya Publishing. All rights reserved.

This book is a blending —  
of spice and softness,  
fire and flour,  
cumin and cast-iron,  
roots and rebirth.

It is the story of how two souls became one kitchen.

# 💛 **DEDICATION**

For the ones who taught us how to love,  
for the ones we are loving now,  
and for the ones who will someday read these pages  
to understand where they came from.

For **our children** —  
Ethan, Gracie, Ayden, and Denali —  
the reason our home is loud, alive, and flavored with joy.

For **us**,  
Hannah & Prasad —  
who learned that blending two cultures is not a compromise,  
but a celebration.

And for anyone who has ever stood between worlds  
and wondered if their story was enough —  
it is.  
It always has been.

# ✨ **AUTHOR’S NOTE — Where Our Story Begins**

Every culture has its own definition of comfort.

For Prasad, comfort was:

- steaming dal poured over hot rice,
- the sharp pop of mustard seeds in peanut oil,
- coconut blooming in a coastal curry,
- his mother’s voice calling him to the table.

For me, comfort was:

- hot biscuits rising in a cast-iron skillet,
- sweet tea sweating down a mason jar,
- garlic-butter green beans at Sunday dinner,
- the warmth of magnolia-blessed summers.

When we met, our kitchens did not match.  
Our spices did not match.  
Our instincts did not match.  
But our hearts recognized each other like an echo.

Food became our translator.  
Our peace treaty.  
Our playground.  
Our therapy.  
Our story.

This book is not simply a cookbook.  
It’s a memoir of the meals that helped us become us —  
the quiet ones, the bold ones, the healing ones,  
and the ones we still laugh about.

It is about:  
✨ memory  
✨ forgiveness  
✨ culture  
✨ home  
✨ and choosing each other again and again, even in the messy moments.

This is the beginning.  
Welcome to our New Moon.
