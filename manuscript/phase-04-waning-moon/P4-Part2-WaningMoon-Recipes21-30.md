# 🌖🌘 **PHASE 4 — WANING MOON**  
## **Part 2 — Recipes 21–30**  
### *Masala & Magnolia: A Journey of Recipes and Stories from Our Maharashtrian & Southern Kitchen*

These final Waning Moon recipes slow everything down.  
They are bowls and plates meant to be eaten with soft breaths, quiet thoughts, and gratitude for what is being released.

Food that comforts rather than excites.  
Food that restores rather than stimulates.  
Food that feels like a warm hand on the back.

Let’s finish this gentle lunar phase with offerings that ground the spirit.
