# Workflow

Authoring flow:
- Create an issue for a new recipe or essay.
- Branch from `feature/<issue-number>-short-description`.
- Author in the appropriate `manuscript/<phase>` folder.

Branch strategy: `main` (protected), `feature/*`, `docs/*`, `fix/*`.

File naming and delivery:
- Each Part is exactly one `.md` file. DO NOT rename or split parts.
