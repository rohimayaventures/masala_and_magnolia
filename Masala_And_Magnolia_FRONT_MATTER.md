# 💛 **Dedication**

*For Prasad —  
the Phoenix who taught the Magnolia how to rise again.*

*For our children —  
may you always taste both where you come from  
and where you’re going.*

*For my Southern roots, which made me,  
and my Maharashtrian family, who completed me.*

# 🪷 **Author’s Preface**

Food has always been my love language.  
Before I ever knew the man who would become my husband — before chai became my morning ritual and before masala mingled with magnolia blossoms in my kitchen — food was how I healed, connected, and learned who I was.

Years later, as our worlds blended, I learned something extraordinary:  
**food is also a bridge.**  
A bridge between cultures, between families, between ways of loving.

This book is that bridge.

It’s our story — told through recipes, memories, moon phases, and the quiet magic that happens when two kitchens on opposite sides of the world learn to speak to each other.

As you read these pages, I hope you feel:
- **Held** by the warmth of Southern comfort food  
- **Awakened** by the depth of Maharashtrian spice traditions  
- **Inspired** by our blended family story  
- **Encouraged** to create your own rituals  

Welcome to our table.  
You belong here.
